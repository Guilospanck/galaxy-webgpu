# Galaxy WebGPU

Web application that uses the [WebGPU API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) to build a full customisable Galaxy based on different parameters that can be tweaked in real time.

See it at [Galaxy](https://guilospanck.github.io/galaxy-webgpu/).

> [!TIP]
> The application when first opened will most likely not show any planets. That is NOT a bug. Scroll your mouse to zoom in and out. Click and drag to pan (if you hold shift while doing so it will rotate the camera).

## Running locally

```shell
pnpm install
```

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Then go to `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port vite might allocate for you) to see the application running.
